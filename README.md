# Persian-Incursion-RL

**Reinforcement Learning framework for the digital wargame _Persian Incursion_.**

This project implements a self-play + training loop using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a policy–value model to explore AI strategies in the _Persian Incursion_ simulation.  
It supports both **Google Colab** and **Docker GPU** execution environments.
